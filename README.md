frontend-nanodegree-Neighborhood Map
===============================
The Neighborhood Map is simple, responsive design, web application that shows a few points of interest in the Dayton area.


1 - Running the application - Simply open index.html in a chrome browser to get started.  Other browsers have not been tested    

2- Features:

a) Google map integration - Map and location pins are generated from Google maps and will automatically adjust on window resize

b) Location information window - Clicking on the pins or respective item in the navigation menu will display information related to the location.  Pins change color and animate when selected

c) Wikipedia information - If locations have Wikipedia information, it will be displayed in the info window.  If Wikipedia is unavailable, or no information is available, an appropriate status will be displayed in the info window

d) Location list navigation menu - Displays list of locations in the area. Clicking an item will display the location's info window

e) Location filter - Filters location list based on a single text string.  It will update the pins that are displayed on the map as well

f) Responsive design - Application will automatically adjust for narrow browser width and when viewed on a mobile device.    

3 - TODOs

a) Dynamic location selection - Load a location based on user input and get points of interest from Google. 

b) Add additional information sources (pictures, etc.)

c) User selectable third party information - Provide UI that allows user to select what data to aggregate
